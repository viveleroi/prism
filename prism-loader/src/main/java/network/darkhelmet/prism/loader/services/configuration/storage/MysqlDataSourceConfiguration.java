            Enable stored procedures. Stored procedures allow Prism to modify database records

            However, your MySQL account must have privileges to `CREATE ROUTINE`.
            If you use a shared MySQL database, you likely do NOT have such permission.
            If you're unsure, Prism tells you in the server console during server startup.
            Prism will force disable this setting if you do not have necessary permission.""")
